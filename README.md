# Text-based-Adventure-game
This Repository holds my task One Project of Text based Adventure Game.
Goal: Develop a text-based adventure game using Python. The game should be interactive, where users make choices to navigate through different scenarios. The game will include features such as multiple paths, inventory management, and decision-based outcomes. Implement basic Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and functions to create a rich user experience.

Structure:
        -User Interface: Design a console-based user interface for input and output, allowing users to interact with the calculator using simple commands or GUI using libraries like Tkinter (optional).
        -Functionality: Implement features to perform basic arithmetic operations, error handling for invalid inputs, and support for decimal or integer inputs.
        -Reports: Generate reports or logs of performed operations (optional) and save them into a text file or a database.

Technologies:
        -Python: For developing the application’s core logic and features.
        -Tkinter (Optional): For building a GUI-based calculator with buttons, input fields, and result displays.
        -SQLite (Optional): For saving the history of operations performed by the user.

Optional:
        -SQLite: For persistent data storage to save the user’s history of calculations.
        -Pandas (Optional): For storing the history in a table format and generating reports for operations performed.
        -Logging: For generating logs of calculations performed and storing them for later reference.

Deliverables:
       -Complete Python project files (including source code and necessary configuration files).
       -A Python executable or script for running the application.
       -Documentation of the application’s functionality, usage, and setup.
